# MarchMaintenance

This is the readme for the my Software Design class maintenantce project.
In this project we take the work from last semester's students (whose names are all embeded in comments within the code) and
we make tweaks to debug and improve original code.

This project is a March Madness Bracket simulater where users can make their March madness brackets and simulate their bracket
with actual tournament results.
